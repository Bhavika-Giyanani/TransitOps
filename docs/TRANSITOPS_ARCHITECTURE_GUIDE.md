## 1. The "Explain Like I'm Five" Domain Intro

Imagine you run a toy store, and you own **10 toy trucks** and have **10 friend helpers** to drive them around your neighborhood delivering Lego sets. 

At first, with 1 truck and 1 friend, it's easy:
- You tell your friend: *"Take this box to Timmy's house down the street."*
- Your friend rides over, hands the box to Timmy, comes back, and you give them a cookie.

Now imagine you grow bigger. You now have:
- **50 big 18-wheel trucks** and vans.
- **70 full-time drivers**.
- **Hundreds of packages** every day going between different cities.
- **Gasoline / Diesel tanks** that cost thousands of dollars to fill up.
- **Tires that wear out** and oil that needs to be changed before the engine catches fire.
- **Government laws** saying: *"If a driver's commercial license expired, they are NOT allowed to drive on the road, period!"*

This is called **Fleet Management & Logistics**. 
**TransitOps** is the central computer system (the "mission control tower") that helps a company run this entire operation smoothly, safely, legally, and without wasting money.

## 2. The Life of a Delivery: The Real-World Pipeline

Every action in TransitOps follows a strict real-world pipeline:

```
[1. Asset Acquisition]  -> Buy Vehicle & Register Driver
         │
         ▼
[2. Cargo & Dispatch]   -> Create Trip: Assign Cargo Weight, Source, Destination
         │                 (Check: Cargo <= Vehicle Capacity? Driver License Valid? Vehicle Not Broken?)
         ▼
[3. Active Transit]     -> Dispatch Trip: Vehicle is "On Trip", Driver is "On Trip"
         │                 Radar tracks position & route corridor
         ▼
[4. Trip Completion]   -> Driver Turn-In: Record Final Odometer & Liters of Fuel Consumed
         │                 Calculate actual distance & fuel burned
         ▼
[5. Maintenance Check] -> Does odometer exceed service intervals?
         │                 Yes -> Vehicle status = "In Shop", create Maintenance Work Order
         ▼
[6. Financial Audit]   -> Revenue earned - (Fuel Cost + Maintenance Cost) = Profit Margin!
```

If any software bug allows a broken truck to be assigned to a trip, or an unlicensed driver to take cargo, real-world accidents and legal fines happen. **That is why the database constraints and business rules you write in .NET are super important!**

---

## 3. The Roles: Who Sees What & Why? (The Secret Behind RBAC)

In software development, **RBAC** stands for **Role-Based Access Control**. 
Why don't we just show every user the exact same giant screen with all the buttons?

> **Analogy Time:** 
> When you board a commercial airplane:
> - The **Captain** needs dials for altitude, engine thrust, and weather radar.
> - The **Flight Attendant** needs seat numbers, meal trays, and emergency exits.
> - The **Mechanic** needs hydraulic pressure gauges and turbine temperature logs.
> - The **Airline Accountant** needs ticket revenue and jet fuel invoices.
>
> If you put ticket invoice forms in front of the pilot while landing, or put an engine thrust lever in front of the accountant, bad things happen! This is called **Cognitive Overload** and **Privilege Leaks**.

Here is why each role in TransitOps has a custom dashboard:

| Role | What They See | What Is Hidden | Why It's Designed This Way |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Organization Admin** | • Organization account list<br>• Create Fleet Manager, Driver, Safety Officer, and Financial Analyst accounts | • Fleet operations unless also assigned an operational role<br>• Ability to create another Organization Admin | **The Organization Owner**: Provisions accounts inside the purchased organization's tenant. The first Organization Admin is created only after verified purchase and single-use account setup. |
| **Fleet Manager** | • Live Route Radar Map<br>• Fleet Utilization %<br>• Quick Action: Create Trip<br>• Quick Action: Register Vehicle<br>• Active Dispatches Table | • Secret employee salary data<br>• Deep tax accounting | **The General**: Coordinates assets. Needs to know which trucks are moving, which are sitting idle, and who can take the next batch of cargo. |
| **Driver** (not a separate Dispatcher role) | • Active Dispatches<br>• Pending Departure Queue<br>• "Dispatch Now" button<br>• "Complete Delivery" modal (Odometer & Fuel log) | • Company profit margins<br>• Financial ledgers<br>• Driver suspension controls | **The Boots on the Ground**: Cares about *execution*. The current backend grants trip operations tenant-wide; that is not equivalent to driver-only assignment enforcement. |
| **Safety Officer** | • Expired License alerts<br>• Expiring in &lt;30 days matrix<br>• "Suspend Driver" button<br>• "Send Reminder Notice" email<br>• Maintenance safety locks | • Live radar map<br>• Financial margins<br>• New trip creation | **The Guardian / Inspector**: Their only mission is safety compliance and preventing lawsuits. If a driver's license expired yesterday, they must have the power to instantly ground them. |
| **Financial Analyst** | • Total Fleet OPEX<br>• Fuel Spend vs Maintenance Breakdown<br>• Cost Per Kilometer ($/km)<br>• Trip Profitability Ledger<br>• CSV Financial Ledger Export | • Live vehicle GPS radar<br>• Dispatch / Cancel buttons<br>• Driver suspension toggles | **The Accountant**: Looks backwards and forwards at cash flow. Did Trip #TRIP-102 make money or lose money after paying for 120 liters of diesel? |

The original requirement permits either a Driver or a Dispatcher role. This application defines only Driver, and does not treat it as a separate Dispatcher role.

Public self-registration is disabled. Development startup idempotently seeds the demo tenant data and accounts when `DemoAccounts:Password` is configured in .NET User Secrets. In production, users must belong to an organization and be created by its Organization Admin; purchase fulfillment must provision that first admin through a trusted integration.

## 4. How to Think About KPIs Like a Backend Engineer

### What is a KPI?
**KPI** stands for **Key Performance Indicator**. Think of it like the **HUD (Heads-Up Display)** in a video game: your health bar, shield points, and ammo count. It summarizes thousands of data points into one single number so humans can make decisions in 2 seconds.

### Page-by-Page KPI Breakdown & How to Compute Them in SQL / .NET

#### A. Fleet Manager KPIs
1. **Active Dispatches**: 
   - *Meaning:* How many vehicles are moving on the highway right now?
   - *Database Logic:* `COUNT(Trips)` WHERE `Status == 'Dispatched'`
2. **Available Assets**:
   - *Meaning:* How many trucks are parked in the yard ready for work?
   - *Database Logic:* `COUNT(Vehicles)` WHERE `Status == 'Available'`
3. **Maintenance Holds**:
   - *Meaning:* Trucks currently being repaired in the shop.
   - *Database Logic:* `COUNT(Vehicles)` WHERE `Status == 'In Shop'`
4. **Fleet Utilization Rate (%)**:
   - *Meaning:* What percentage of our total vehicle investments are actively generating value vs sitting idle?
   - *Database Logic:* `(ActiveVehicles / TotalNonRetiredVehicles) * 100`

#### B. Driver / Dispatcher KPIs
1. **Pending Departure Queue**:
   - *Meaning:* Planned cargo trips waiting for a driver to grab keys and depart.
   - *Database Logic:* `COUNT(Trips)` WHERE `Status == 'Draft'`
2. **Delivered Runs**:
   - *Meaning:* Completed deliveries successfully turned in today/this month.
   - *Database Logic:* `COUNT(Trips)` WHERE `Status == 'Completed'`

#### C. Safety Officer KPIs
1. **Expired Licenses**:
   - *Meaning:* Drivers legally prohibited from driving.
   - *Database Logic:* `COUNT(Drivers)` WHERE `LicenseExpiryDate < TODAY`
2. **Expiring in &lt; 30 Days**:
   - *Meaning:* Urgent warnings before a driver gets auto-grounded.
   - *Database Logic:* `COUNT(Drivers)` WHERE `LicenseExpiryDate BETWEEN TODAY AND (TODAY + 30 Days)`
3. **Average Safety Score**:
   - *Meaning:* The overall safety health of the driver fleet (0 to 100).
   - *Database Logic:* `AVG(Drivers.SafetyScore)`

#### D. Financial Analyst KPIs
1. **Total Fleet OPEX (Operating Expenses)**:
   - *Meaning:* Every penny spent keeping the trucks rolling.
   - *Database Logic:* `SUM(MaintenanceRecords.Cost) + SUM(FuelExpenses.Cost) + SUM(OtherExpenses.Cost)`
2. **Gross Revenue**:
   - *Meaning:* How much clients paid us for hauling freight.
   - *Database Logic:* `SUM(Trips.Revenue)` WHERE `Status == 'Completed'`
3. **Net Margin (%)**:
   - *Meaning:* How much profit is kept after paying expenses.
   - *Database Logic:* `((GrossRevenue - TotalOpex) / GrossRevenue) * 100`
4. **Operating Cost per Kilometer ($/km)**:
   - *Meaning:* Efficiency metric. How much does 1 kilometer of travel cost the business?
   - *Database Logic:* `TotalOpex / SUM(Trips.PlannedDistanceKm)`

## 7. Writing High-Performance EF Core KPI Queries

A common beginner mistake is loading thousands of records into memory with `.ToList()` and then doing `.Count()` or `.Sum()` in C#. This crashes your server when you have 100,000 trips!

Instead, **let the SQL database compute the aggregates in a single network round-trip**:

### Example: Financial Analyst Dashboard Query
```csharp
public async Task<FinancialKpiDto> GetFinancialKpisAsync(TransitOpsDbContext db, CancellationToken ct)
{
    // 1. Calculate Fuel and Maintenance in SQL
    var maintenanceCost = await db.MaintenanceRecords
        .SumAsync(m => (decimal?)m.Cost, ct) ?? 0m;

    var loggedFuelCost = await db.Expenses
        .Where(e => e.Type == ExpenseType.Fuel)
        .SumAsync(e => (decimal?)e.Amount, ct) ?? 0m;

    var otherExpenses = await db.Expenses
        .Where(e => e.Type != ExpenseType.Fuel)
        .SumAsync(e => (decimal?)e.Amount, ct) ?? 0m;

    // 2. Calculate Completed Trips Revenue & Distance in 1 query
    var tripStats = await db.Trips
        .Where(t => t.Status == TripStatus.Completed)
        .GroupBy(_ => 1)
        .Select(g => new
        {
            TotalRevenue = g.Sum(t => t.Revenue),
            TotalDistanceKm = g.Sum(t => t.PlannedDistanceKm),
            EstimatedFuelSpend = g.Sum(t => (t.FuelConsumedLiters ?? (t.PlannedDistanceKm * 0.18m)) * 1.45m)
        })
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync(ct);

    decimal grossRevenue = tripStats?.TotalRevenue ?? 0m;
    decimal fuelCost = Math.Max(loggedFuelCost, tripStats?.EstimatedFuelSpend ?? 0m);
    decimal totalOpex = maintenanceCost + fuelCost + otherExpenses;
    decimal netMargin = grossRevenue > 0 ? ((grossRevenue - totalOpex) / grossRevenue) * 100m : 0m;
    decimal costPerKm = (tripStats?.TotalDistanceKm > 0) ? (totalOpex / tripStats.TotalDistanceKm) : 0m;

    return new FinancialKpiDto(
        TotalOpex: totalOpex,
        FuelSpend: fuelCost,
        MaintenanceSpend: maintenanceCost,
        GrossRevenue: grossRevenue,
        NetMarginPercentage: Math.Round(netMargin, 1),
        CostPerKm: Math.Round(costPerKm, 2)
    );
}
```

### Example: Safety Officer Compliance Query
```csharp
public async Task<SafetyKpiDto> GetSafetyKpisAsync(TransitOpsDbContext db, CancellationToken ct)
{
    var today = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.UtcNow);
    var warningThreshold = today.AddDays(30);

    var driverStats = await db.Drivers
        .GroupBy(_ => 1)
        .Select(g => new
        {
            ExpiredCount = g.Count(d => d.LicenseExpiryDate < today),
            ExpiringSoonCount = g.Count(d => d.LicenseExpiryDate >= today && d.LicenseExpiryDate <= warningThreshold),
            SuspendedCount = g.Count(d => d.Status == DriverStatus.Suspended),
            CompliantCount = g.Count(d => d.LicenseExpiryDate >= today && d.Status != DriverStatus.Suspended),
            AverageSafetyScore = g.Average(d => (double?)d.SafetyScore) ?? 100.0
        })
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync(ct);

    var activeWorkOrders = await db.MaintenanceRecords
        .CountAsync(m => m.Status == MaintenanceStatus.Active, ct);

    return new SafetyKpiDto(
        ExpiredLicenses: driverStats?.ExpiredCount ?? 0,
        ExpiringSoon: driverStats?.ExpiringSoonCount ?? 0,
        SuspendedDrivers: driverStats?.SuspendedCount ?? 0,
        CompliantDrivers: driverStats?.CompliantCount ?? 0,
        InShopInspectionLocks: activeWorkOrders,
        AverageSafetyScore: Math.Round(driverStats?.AverageSafetyScore ?? 100.0, 0)
    );
}
```

## 8. API Route Blueprint & Business Invariants

When implementing ASP.NET Core endpoints, enforce these **Golden Business Invariants**:

### Rule 1: Never Overload Cargo
```csharp
// POST /api/trips
if (request.CargoWeightKg > vehicle.MaxCapacityKg)
{
    return Results.BadRequest(new {
        Error = $"Cargo weight ({request.CargoWeightKg} kg) exceeds vehicle max payload capacity ({vehicle.MaxCapacityKg} kg)."
    });
}
```

### Rule 2: Ground Expired or Suspended Drivers
```csharp
// POST /api/trips/dispatch
if (driver.Status == DriverStatus.Suspended || driver.LicenseExpiryDate < DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.UtcNow))
{
    return Results.UnprocessableEntity(new {
        Error = "Driver is legally grounded due to an expired commercial license or active safety suspension."
    });
}
```

### Rule 3: Atomic Trip Dispatching & Completion
When a trip is dispatched:
1. `Trip.Status = TripStatus.Dispatched`
2. `Vehicle.Status = VehicleStatus.OnTrip`
3. `Driver.Status = DriverStatus.OnTrip`
*(Wrap in an EF Core transaction `using var tx = await db.Database.BeginTransactionAsync()` so either all 3 update or none do!)*

When a trip completes:
1. `Trip.Status = TripStatus.Completed`
2. `Trip.FinalOdometerKm = request.FinalOdometer`
3. `Trip.FuelConsumedLiters = request.FuelConsumed`
4. `Vehicle.CurrentOdometerKm = request.FinalOdometer`
5. `Vehicle.Status = VehicleStatus.Available`
6. `Driver.Status = DriverStatus.Available`
7. `Driver.TotalTripsCompleted += 1`
8. Check if odometer triggered a scheduled service interval -> if so, switch vehicle to `InShop`!

## 💡 Summary Checklist for the .NET Backend Team
- [x] **Entities Created:** Vehicle, Driver, Trip, MaintenanceRecord, ExpenseRecord, UserAccount.
- [x] **Relational Rules Set:** Unique indices on registration number, license number, and trip codes. Cascade delete restricted on trips to preserve audit history.
- [x] **Role Access Policies Configured:** Use ASP.NET Core Authorization Policies (`[Authorize(Roles = "FleetManager,Driver")]`).
- [x] **Aggregations Optimized:** KPI queries grouped in SQL to prevent memory leaks and maintain sub-50ms response times.
- [x] **Status State Machine Respected:** Vehicles and drivers cleanly transition states (`Available` -> `OnTrip` -> `Available` / `InShop`).
